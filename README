# Plantsense

Welcome to plantsense, a Python project.

## Project Overview
PlantSense is a comprehensive project designed to leverage the capabilities of web development, IoT, and distributed systems. This system uses a variety of sensors to monitor key environmental variables such as soil moisture, humidity, temperature, alongside video and camera outputs for real-time plant monitoring. The aim is to provide a detailed, real-time overview of plant conditions accessible via a user-friendly web app.

## Features
- Real-time Data Monitoring: Track soil moisture, humidity, and temperature through a series of IoT sensors.
- Video Surveillance: Monitor your plants with live video feeds and stored recordings.
- Web App Interface: Control and view your plant's environment through an intuitive web application.
- Data Storage: Collect and store telemetry data in a database for historical analysis and trend observation.
- Distributed Architecture: Utilize distributed systems principles to manage data streaming, processing, and web application handling.

## Technology Stack
- Sensors: Capacitive soil moisture sensor, DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor, Raspberry Pi Camera Module.
- Back End: Node.js, Python for sensor data collection and processing.
- Front End: React for the web application, HTML/CSS for layout and styling.
- Database: MongoDB or SQL for data storage.
- Distributed Systems: Docker or Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration.
